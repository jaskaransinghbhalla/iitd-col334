    If you're not observing a direct connection between two hosts during a Microsoft Teams call, it's likely due to the way Teams handles network connections. Here's an explanation of what could be happening:

Relay Servers:
Microsoft Teams often uses relay servers to facilitate connections. This means that instead of a direct peer-to-peer connection, the traffic is routed through Microsoft's infrastructure.
NAT Traversal:
Many users are behind Network Address Translation (NAT) devices, which can make direct connections difficult. Teams uses techniques like STUN and TURN to overcome these barriers.
Improved Reliability:
Routing through Microsoft's servers can provide better connection quality and reliability, especially across different networks or geographic locations.
Security:
Using relay servers can enhance security by obscuring the direct IP addresses of participants.
Firewall Bypassing:
Many corporate firewalls block peer-to-peer connections. Routing through known Microsoft servers helps bypass these restrictions.
Traffic Optimization:
Microsoft can optimize the route of the traffic through their global network, potentially providing better performance than a direct internet path between peers.
Multi-party Calls:
In calls with more than two participants, using a central relay point is more efficient than multiple peer-to-peer connections.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the process:

Connection Establishment:

When a call is initiated, both clients contact Microsoft's servers using STUN/TURN protocols.
These servers help determine the best way to establish the connection.


Media Relay:

If a direct connection isn't possible, the audio/video streams (RTP/SRTP packets) are sent to Microsoft's relay servers.
These servers then forward the packets to the other participant(s).


Signaling:

Call setup, control messages, and other signaling data typically go through Microsoft's Teams services, often using HTTPS or secure WebSocket connections.


Endpoints:

You'll likely see your client connecting to an IP address in Microsoft's range (often 52.112.0.0/14 for Teams).
The other participant will typically connect to a different IP in the same range.



This approach allows Teams to provide reliable communication even in complex network environments, at the cost of slightly increased latency compared to a direct peer-to-peer connection. It's a trade-off between reliability, security, and performance that Microsoft has deemed optimal for most use cases.
