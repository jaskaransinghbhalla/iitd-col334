## Autograder 

### How to use?

Initial State :
- Keep your zip file in submissions dir, zip should inflate directly to part1, part2, part3, part4
- While evaluating, in solution dir, TA submission will exist but for now you can keep your part1, part2, part3, part4

- Autograder will cross verifiy your clients, servers with TA's clients and servers.

- It will also note your submission's execution time. We will use this detail to detect anomalies. Source code for these anomalies will be flagged and will be verified manually too. If we found any hack in your implementation which is not allowed (like instead of threading, implementing sequentially) then it will incur you penalty. Note that, Penalties can vary.

- We will also compare the plot generated by your code with what you would have added in report.pdf.

- At the start of run.sh, you can change the paths of output, input and solution. These paths are variable and will be changed during final evaluation.
